/** Heap12 class that implements an unbounded array-backed heap structure and is
 * an extension of the Java Collections AbstractQueue class 
 * <p>
 * The elements of the heap are ordered according to their natural 
 * ordering,  Heap12 does not permit null elements. 
 * The top of this heap is the minimal or maximal element (called min/max)  
 * with respect to the specified natural ordering.  
 * If multiple elements are tied for min/max value, the top is one of 
 * those elements -- ties are broken arbitrarily. 
 * The queue retrieval operations poll, remove, peek, and element 
 * access the element at the top of the heap.
 * <p>
 * A Heap12 is unbounded, but has an internal capacity governing the size of 
 * an array used to store the elements on the queue. It is always at least as 
 * large as the queue size. As elements are added to a Heap12, its capacity 
 * grows automatically. The details of the growth policy are not specified.
 * <p>
 * This class and its iterator implements the optional methods of the 
 * Iterator interface (including remove()). The Iterator provided in method 
 * iterator() is not guaranteed to traverse the elements of the Heap12 in 
 * any particular order. 
 * <p>
 * Note that this implementation is not synchronized. Multiple threads 
 * should not access a Heap12 instance concurrently if any of the 
 * threads modifies the Heap12.
